6. [Write a Python class to find the three elements that sum to zero from a set of n real numbers.](https://github.com/jugalw13/Python_Lab/blob/master/Open%20Elective%20Python/Unit%204/6.py)

7. [Write an interactive program to compute the square root of a number. The input values must be tested for validity. if it is negative the user defined method MySqrt() should raise an exception.](https://github.com/jugalw13/Python_Lab/blob/master/Open%20Elective%20Python/Unit%204/7.py)

8. [Write a Python class to implement pow(x, n)](https://github.com/jugalw13/Python_Lab/blob/master/Open%20Elective%20Python/Unit%204/8.py)

9. [Write a Python class to find a pair of elements (indices of the two numbers) from a given array whose sum equals a specific target number.](https://github.com/jugalw13/Python_Lab/blob/master/Open%20Elective%20Python/Unit%204/9.py)

10. [Write a Python class to reverse a string word by word.](https://github.com/jugalw13/Python_Lab/blob/master/Open%20Elective%20Python/Unit%204/10.py)
