# Unit 3

1. Design and implement a program to create and read the contents of a file that resembles a phone book with names and phone numbers. Now alphabetically sort the phonebook.

2. Design and implement a python program to create and read a file, store it in a list of lists, with each inner list containing the product name, net weight and the unit price of a product, by name shopper_list.txt that contains the name, weight and the unit price of the products in supermarket:
```
Wheat flour 1kg 25.00
Rice flour 1kg 40.00
```
3. Design and implement a program to open a file and count the occurrences of each letter in the file.

4. Design and implement a program that reads a file and outputs a new file with the lines in a sorted order.

5. Write a program segment that reads a text file named original_text, and displays how many times the letter ‘c’ occurs.

6. Write a Python program to count the number of lines in a text file.

7. Write a Python program to get current time in milliseconds in Python using the time module.

8. Write a Python program to generate random even integers in a specific numerical range using the random module

9. Write a function that takes a list of integers, and returns the number of primes in the list.

10. Write a program that reads a file and writes out a new file with the lines in reversed order (i.e. the first line in the old file becomes the last one in the new file.)

11. Write a Python program to generate a series of unique random numbers using the random module.

12. Write a Python program to read a file line by line and store it into a list. Write a python program to find the longest words.

13. Write a python program to produce a list of unique element from the input list which contains duplicates of the elements in the list
```
Expected output:
Input list: [1,2,3,3,3,3,5,6,9,9]
Output list: [1,2,3,5,6,9]
```

14. Write a program that reads a file and prints only those lines that contain the substring snake.

15. Write a Python program to get a single random element from a specified string

16. Write a Python program to get a single random element from a specified string using the random module.

17. Write a Python program to print a string five times, delay three seconds using the time module.

18. Write a Python program to count the frequency of words in a file.

19. Design and implement a program that reads a file and prints only those lines that contain the substring “msrit”
